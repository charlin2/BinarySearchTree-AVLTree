# CSDS 233 Project 3 - Binary Search Tree and Self-Balancing Tree

BST and AVL Tree implementation in Java.

Note that this implementation **can** store any *comparable* type.

## Features
- BST
  - insert
    - BST order remains invariant after insertion
  - delete
    - BST order remains invariant after deletion
  - search
  - inorder: in-order traversal of BST
  - kthSmallest: returns the *k*-th smallest element in the BST
- AVL Tree
  - insert
    - Tree balance is >= 1 after insertion
  - delete
    - Tree balance is >= 1 after insertion
  - search
  - inorder: in-order traversal
  - postorder: post-order traversal

 Unit testing and demonstrations included.
